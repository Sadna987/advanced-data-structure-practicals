# Algorithm Implementations

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of several essential algorithms in data structures and graph theory. The programs include sorting, selection, tree operations, graph algorithms, and pattern matching.

## Implemented Algorithms
1. **Randomized Quick Sort**  
   - Sorts the elements of an array using a randomized approach.
   - Reports the number of comparisons made during sorting.

2. **Randomized Select**  
   - Finds the `i`th smallest element of an array efficiently.

3. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal’s Algorithm)**  
   - Determines the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Kruskal’s approach.

4. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**  
   - Computes the shortest paths from a given source node to all other nodes in a graph.
   - Works with graphs that may contain negative-weight edges.

5. **B-Tree Implementation**  
   - Implements a B-Tree data structure for efficient database indexing.

6. **Pattern Search (Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm)**  
   - Searches for a pattern in a given text using the KMP string-matching algorithm.

7. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**  
   - Implements a tree data structure that supports:
     - **Insertion**
     - **Search**
